# Invalid props

## Methodology
Tested using cyclic lemmas + half lemmas

## Results

- prop_04
  - Prop: (S (count n xs)) = (count n (Cons n xs))
  - Reason: UNKNOWN (0.09 sec)
  - Suspected Reason: Depth exceeded
  - Able to prove with uncycling
- prop_20:
  - (len (sort xs)) = (len xs)
  - Reason: UNKNOWN (1.05 sec)
  - Suspected Reason: Timeout
  - Intractable?
- prop_52
  - (count n xs) = (count n (rev xs))
  - Reason: UNKNOWN
  - Suspected Reason: Timeout
  - Intractable?
- prop_53
  - (count n xs) = (count n (sort xs))
  - Reason: UNKNOWN (10.63 sec)
  - Suspected Reason: Timeout
  - Intractable?
- prop_54
  - (sub (add m n) n) = m
  - Reason: UNKNOWN (0.24 sec)
  - Suspected Reason: Need to prove lemma on smaller part
  - n_Sn problem
- prop_65
  - (lt i (S (add m i))) = True
  - Reason: UNKNOWN (0.12 sec)
  - Suspected Reason: Need to prove lemma on smaller part
  - n_Sn problem

  - Reason: UNKNOWN (0.32 sec)
  - Suspected Reason: Timeout
  - Worth investigating?
- prop_68
  - (leq (len (delete n xs)) (len xs)) = True
  - Reason: UNKNOWN (2.12 sec)
  - Suspected Reason: Timeout
  - Worth investigating?
- prop_69
  - (leq n (add m n)) = True
  - Reason: UNKNOWN (0.08 sec)
  - Known Reason: Need to prove lemma on smaller part
    - Can prove: (leq k (add m (S n))) = (leq k (S (add m n)))
    - Gets stuck: (leq n (add m (S n))) = (leq n (S (add m n)))
      - Reason: Cannot recurse
  - n_Sn problem

  - Reason: UNKNOWN (3.97 sec)
  - Suspected Reason: Timeout
  - Worth investigating?
- prop_47
  - (height (mirror t)) = (height t)
  - Reason: UNKNOWN (many many sec)
